# Casa Website — Project Overview

## Project Purpose
A modern, mobile-first website for Casa [hotel/restaurant name], designed to showcase our hospitality, drive direct bookings, and strengthen our brand identity online.

## Primary Goals / KPIs
- Increase direct bookings by 15% within 6 months of launch.
- Reduce reliance on OTAs (Booking.com, Expedia, etc.) by improving direct channel share.
- Provide a clear, elegant digital presence that reflects our in-person guest experience.
- Build a foundation for future integration with guest app / loyalty features.

## Target Audiences
- **Guests**: prospective visitors researching accommodation and dining.
- **Locals**: restaurant patrons, event attendees, and repeat customers.
- **Event Bookers**: individuals or businesses looking to host private events.

## Constraints
- Launch target: **Spring 2026** (before high season).
- Budget range: **€XXk–€YYk** (TBD).
- Must integrate with our existing PMS/booking engine (Host or Cloudbeds).
- Must adhere to our Brand Kit guidelines (logo, typography, color palette in PDF).

## Next Steps
- Translate this overview into detailed feature specs (homepage, booking flow, restaurant, events).
- Break features into `specs/*.md` files (using `spec-template.md` as scaffold).
- Run Spec-Kit to generate tasks and push to GitHub Issues for tracking.
