## Executive Summary

Casa Vale da Lama faces a unique challenge: launching both a physical property and its digital presence simultaneously while the property is still under construction. This integrated strategy turns that constraint into a **storytelling advantage** by building anticipation through a phased reveal campaign across social media and web platforms.

The strategy leverages the "transformation journey" narrative - showing the property's evolution from construction to completed eco-resort - to build audience investment before the April 1st launch.
