# CASA Website - Spec-Driven Development

## Overview
A CASA website project configured for Spec-Driven Development (SDD) using GitHub's open-source Spec Kit. This project enables you to build professional web applications through a structured specification-first approach with AI assistance.

## Current State
- **Status**: SDD Environment ready and configured
- **Technology**: GitHub Spec Kit with Claude AI integration
- **Workflow**: `/specify` → `/plan` → `/tasks` → Implementation
- **Constitution**: CASA-specific development principles established

## Recent Changes
- **September 13, 2025**: GitHub Spec Kit installation and configuration
  - Installed uvx and GitHub Spec Kit successfully
  - Configured Claude AI assistant for SDD workflow
  - Created CASA-specific project constitution
  - Set up SDD environment with workflow demonstration
  - Organized project structure for specification-driven development

## Spec-Driven Development Architecture

### SDD Command Structure
- `/specify` - Create feature specifications from natural language descriptions
- `/plan` - Generate technical implementation plans from specifications
- `/tasks` - Break down plans into actionable development tasks

### Project Organization
```
.specify/
├── memory/
│   ├── constitution.md                 - CASA project principles & constraints
│   └── constitution_update_checklist.md
├── scripts/bash/                       - SDD workflow automation scripts
└── templates/                          - Specification and plan templates

.claude/
└── commands/                           - SDD command definitions for Claude
```

### SDD Workflow Process
1. **Specify**: Describe what you want to build in natural language
2. **Plan**: Provide technical direction and generate detailed implementation plans
3. **Tasks**: Generate dependency-ordered, actionable development tasks
4. **Implement**: Code with AI assistance following specifications

## CASA Constitution Highlights
- **User-Centric Design**: Accessibility and UX priority
- **Professional Standards**: Business-appropriate quality
- **Responsive-First**: Mobile-first approach (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **Performance Optimization**: <3 second load times
- **SEO & Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance required

## Development Notes
- SDD environment running on Python with console output
- All specifications follow constitutional constraints
- Test-driven development integrated into task generation
- Cross-device compatibility mandatory for all features

## User Preferences
- Specification-driven development methodology
- Constitutional compliance for all features
- Professional web development standards
- AI-assisted implementation with clear specifications

## Next Steps - Getting Started with SDD
1. **Start Specifying**: Use `/specify` to describe your first feature
   Example: `/specify Build a professional homepage with hero section, about us, and contact form`

2. **Generate Plans**: Use `/plan` to add technical direction
   Example: `/plan Use modern CSS Grid layout with vanilla JavaScript`

3. **Create Tasks**: Use `/tasks` to generate actionable development steps
   Example: `/tasks Generate specific implementation tasks`

4. **Begin Implementation**: Follow the generated tasks with AI assistance

## Example SDD Workflow
```
/specify Build a professional website for CASA with modern design,
         contact forms, service showcase, and mobile responsiveness

/plan Use HTML5, CSS3, and vanilla JavaScript. Focus on performance
      and accessibility. Include form validation and smooth animations.

/tasks Generate dependency-ordered tasks for implementation
```

The SDD environment is ready! Start by describing what you want to build using the `/specify` command.
