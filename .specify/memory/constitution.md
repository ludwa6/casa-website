# CASA Website Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. User-Centric Design
All features must prioritize user experience and accessibility. Every interface element should be intuitive, responsive, and accessible to users with disabilities. User feedback drives design decisions.

### II. Professional Standards
The website must maintain a professional appearance and functionality suitable for business use. Clean, modern design with consistent branding and reliable performance.

### III. Responsive-First (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Mobile-first design approach is mandatory. All features must work seamlessly across devices. Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop before implementation.

### IV. Performance Optimization
Page load times must be under 3 seconds. Optimize images, minimize resources, and implement caching strategies. Performance testing required for all major features.

### V. SEO and Accessibility
Search engine optimization and web accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA) are non-negotiable. Semantic HTML, proper heading structure, alt text, and meta descriptions required.

## Technical Constraints

### Technology Stack
- Frontend: Modern web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6+)
- Responsive frameworks: CSS Grid, Flexbox, or modern CSS frameworks
- Performance: Lighthouse score >90 for all metrics
- Browser support: Latest 2 versions of major browsers

### Security Requirements
- All forms must include CSRF protection
- Input validation on both client and server side
- HTTPS deployment required
- No sensitive data in client-side code

## Development Workflow

### Spec-Driven Development Process
1. **Specify**: Create detailed feature specifications using natural language
2. **Plan**: Generate technical implementation plans respecting constitution
3. **Tasks**: Break down into actionable, testable development tasks
4. **Implement**: Code following TDD principles with constitution compliance

### Quality Gates
- All features must pass accessibility audits
- Performance testing required before deployment
- Cross-device testing mandatory
- Code review required for constitution compliance

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices. Any amendments require:
- Documentation of rationale
- Impact assessment
- Migration plan for existing features

All development work must verify compliance with these principles before completion.
