ðŸš€ Next Steps for Your Local VS Code Setup
Copy the CASA WEBSITE folder to your local machine

Open in VS Code and initialize Git repository locally:

cd "CASA WEBSITE"
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial Spec Kit setup"
Create a GitHub repository and connect it:

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/casa-website.git
git push -u origin main
Start using the Spec-Driven Development workflow:

Use /specify command to describe what to build (focus on what/why, not tech stack)
Use /plan command to define technical implementation
Use /tasks command to break down into actionable items
The system verification shows VS Code is available for GitHub Copilot integration, and the Spec Kit is ready to use. The development environment here serves as your testing ground, while your local VS Code environment will be where you execute the full specification workflow with proper Git integration.

Your CASA WEBSITE project is now ready for Spec-Driven Development! ðŸŽ‰
